         <h3>Van Goh</h3>
         <span>Mar 30, 1853 - Jul 29, 1890</span>
         <p>Vincent Willem van Gogh was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who posthumously became one of the most
            famous and influential figures in Western art history. In a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks,
            including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the last two years of his life. They include
            landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic,
            impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. Not commercially
            successful, he struggled with severe depression and poverty, eventually leading to his suicide at age
            thirty-seven.
            Born into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh drew as a child and was serious, quiet, and thoughtful. As
            a young man, he worked as an art dealer, often traveling, but became depressed after he was transferred to
            London. He turned to religion and spent time as a Protestant missionary in southern Belgium. He drifted in
            ill health and solitude before taking up painting in 1881, having moved back home with his parents. His
            younger brother Theo supported him financially, and the two kept a long correspondence by letter.</p>

         <h3>Claude Monet</h3>
         <span>Nov 14, 1840 - Dec 5, 1926</span>
         <p>Oscar-Claude Monet was a French painter and founder of impressionist painting who is seen as a key precursor
            to modernism, especially in his attempts to paint nature as he perceived it. During his long career, he was
            the most consistent and prolific practitioner of impressionism's philosophy of expressing one's perceptions
            before nature, especially as applied to plein air landscape painting. The term "Impressionism" is derived
            from the title of his painting Impression, soleil levant, exhibited in the 1874 Salon des Refusés initiated
            by Monet and his associates as an alternative to the Salon.
            Monet was raised in Le Havre, Normandy, and became interested in the outdoors and drawing from an early age.
            Although his mother, Louise-Justine Aubrée Monet, supported his ambitions to be a painter, his father,
            Claude-Adolphe, disapproved and wanted him to pursue a career in business. He was very close to his mother,
            but she died in January 1857 when he was sixteen years old, and he was sent to live with his childless,
            widowed but wealthy aunt, Marie-Jeanne Lecadre.</p>

         <h3>Jul 15, 1606 - Oct 4, 1669</h3>
         <span>1908 - Jun 20, 1993</span>
         <p>Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn, usually simply known as Rembrandt, was a Dutch Golden Age painter,
            printmaker and draughtsman. An innovative and prolific master in three media, he is generally considered one
            of the greatest visual artists in the history of art and the most important in Dutch art history. Unlike
            most Dutch masters of the 17th century, Rembrandt's works depict a wide range of style and subject matter,
            from portraits and self-portraits to landscapes, genre scenes, allegorical and historical scenes, and
            biblical and mythological themes as well as animal studies. His contributions to art came in a period of
            great wealth and cultural achievement that historians call the Dutch Golden Age, when Dutch art, although in
            many ways antithetical to the Baroque style that dominated Europe, was extremely prolific and innovative and
            gave rise to important new genres. Like many artists of the Dutch Golden Age, such as Jan Vermeer of Delft,
            Rembrandt was also an avid art collector and dealer.</p>

         <h3>Raffael</h3>
         <span>1483 - Apr 6, 1520</span>
         <p>Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino, known as Raphael, was an Italian painter and architect of the High Renaissance.
            His work is admired for its clarity of form, ease of composition, and visual achievement of the Neoplatonic
            ideal of human grandeur. Together with Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, he forms the traditional trinity
            of great masters of that period.
            Raphael was enormously productive, running an unusually large workshop and, despite his early death at 37,
            leaving a large body of work. Many of his works are found in the Vatican Palace, where the frescoed Raphael
            Rooms were the central, and the largest, work of his career. The best known work is The School of Athens in
            the Vatican Stanza della Segnatura. After his early years in Rome, much of his work was executed by his
            workshop from his drawings, with considerable loss of quality. He was extremely influential in his lifetime,
            though outside Rome his work was mostly known from his collaborative printmaking.
            After his death, the influence of his great rival Michelangelo was more widespread until the 18th and 19th
            centuries, when Raphael's more serene and harmonious qualities were again regarded as the highest models.

         <h3>Nguyen Gia Tri</h3>
         <span>1908 - Jun 20, 1993</span>
         <p>Nguyen Gia Tri or Nguyễn Gia Trí was a Vietnamese painter best known for his lacquer paintings.
            He also drew cartoons on political and social issues, many of them criticising French colonial rule.
            Tri studied at the Hanoi College of Fine Arts from 1932.
            He worked for the magazines Phong Hóa and Ngày Nay starting from 1932 together with Nhất Linh and other
            famous writers and painters. He created the cartoon characters Xã Xệ and Bang Bạnh for the magazines and
            made changes to the character Lý Toét developed by Nhất Linh.
